Cambridge Rocketry Simulator v2
==========

Overview
--------

The Cambridge rocketry simulator can be used to produce six-degree-of-freedom simulations of rocket flights, including the parachute descent. Simulations can also be run stochastically, generating splash-down plots.

The software can be used to simulate many different types of rocket and many different scenarios, including two stage flights.

License
-------

The Cambridge rocketry simulator is an Open Source project licensed under the [GNU GPL]. This means that the software is free to use for whatever purposes, and the source code is also available for studying and extending.

Contributing
------------

The Cambridge rocketry simulator needs users, developers, students and rocketeers to contribute, in a variety of different ways, and create an even better rocket flight simulator.
